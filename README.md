ActiveRecordForDrupal
=====================

Active Record for Drupal And Composer.

Tired of using the anonymous arrays Drupal loves to slosh around? Give this a whirl.

Ships with some default models for users, role and users_roles

Should just plug in with Composer into your application, and should just plug into Drupal too.
